Creating a List

# Vector with numerics from 1 up to 10
my_vector <- 1:10 

# Matrix with numerics from 1 up to 9
my_matrix <- matrix(1:9, ncol = 3)

# First 10 elements of the built-in data frame mtcars
my_df <- mtcars[1:10,]

# Construct list with these different elements:
my_list <- list(my_vector, my_matrix, my_df)


Creating a Named List

# Vector with numerics from 1 up to 10
my_vector <- 1:10 

# Matrix with numerics from 1 up to 9
my_matrix <- matrix(1:9, ncol = 3)

# First 10 elements of the built-in data frame mtcars
my_df <- mtcars[1:10,]

# Adapt list() call to give the components names
my_list <- list(my_vector, my_matrix, my_df)
names(my_list) <- c("vec", "mat", "df")
# Print out my_list
my_list


Creating a Named List (2)

# The variables mov, act and rev are available

# Finish the code to build shining_list
shining_list <- list(moviename = mov, actors = act, reviews = rev)


Selecting Elements From a List


# shining_list is already pre-loaded in the workspace

# Print out the vector representing the actors
shining_list[[2]]
shining_list
# Print the second element of the vector representing the actors
shining_list[[2]][2]


Adding More Movie Information to the List

# shining_list, the list containing movie name, actors and reviews, is pre-loaded in the workspace

# We forgot something; add the year to shining_list
shining_list_full <- c(shining_list, year = 1980) 

# Have a look at shining_list_full
str(shining_list_full)
